# Netlify Deployment Checklist

## Project Structure
- [x] Static files (HTML, CSS, JS) in root directory
- [x] Netlify Functions in `netlify/functions/` directory
- [x] Netlify configuration in `netlify.toml`

## Files Required for Deployment
- [x] `index.html` - Main landing page
- [x] `styles.css` - Styling
- [x] `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- [x] `netlify/functions/process-payment.js` - Payment processing function
- [x] `netlify/functions/payment-status.js` - Payment status checking function
- [x] `netlify/functions/health.js` - Health check function

## Netlify Configuration
- [x] Functions directory configured: `netlify/functions`
- [x] Publish directory configured: `.`
- [x] API redirects configured:
  - `/api/*` → `/.netlify/functions/:splat`
  - `/*` → `/index.html` (SPA fallback)

## Frontend Implementation
- [x] Uses `/api/process-payment` endpoint (clean URL through redirects)
- [x] Uses `/api/payment-status` endpoint (clean URL through redirects)
- [x] Proper error handling and user feedback
- [x] Mobile-optimized design

## Backend Implementation (Netlify Functions)
- [x] Payment processing with ZenoPay API
- [x] Payment status checking with retry mechanism
- [x] Proper error handling for network issues
- [x] Logging for debugging purposes
- [x] Security considerations (API key protection)

## Payment Flow
1. [x] User clicks "JIUNGE NA GROUP LANGU LA WHATSAAP" button
2. [x] Popup asks for phone number
3. [x] Frontend sends phone number to `/api/process-payment`
4. [x] Function validates input and sends payment request to ZenoPay API
5. [x] If successful, frontend shows processing message
6. [x] Frontend periodically calls `/api/payment-status` to check payment status
7. [x] When payment is completed, user is redirected to WhatsApp

## Testing
- [x] Verified Netlify Functions structure
- [x] Verified API key configuration
- [x] Tested ZenoPay API connectivity
- [x] Verified frontend API calls
- [x] Verified Netlify configuration

## Deployment Instructions
1. Commit all changes to your Git repository
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Set build command to: `# no build command`
4. Set publish directory to: `.`
5. Deploy!

## Post-Deployment Verification
After deployment, verify:
1. Static site loads correctly
2. `/api/health` endpoint returns success
3. Payment flow works end-to-end
4. Error handling works properly

This project is now fully configured as a static site that works with Netlify Functions for backend processing.
